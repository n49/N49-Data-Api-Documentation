#N49-Data-Api-Documentation

##About

**Documentation for Integrating with The N49.ca Data-API**

The API allows trusted partners of N49.ca to publish, update, and delete listings in our network of local business directories. This includes adding photos, phone numbers, videos, updating business hours, address, etc.

### How do I get started?

Start by sending an email to [Rick Silver](mailto:ricksilver@n49.com?Subject=Hey%20Let%20me%20at%20that%20sweet%20n49.ca%20API), head of product at n49. He will hook you up with an API key.

## Endpoints
There are two primary endpoints, a developement and production endpoint. The data on the development endpoint is wiped every night and replaced with the latest production data. Anything pushed to the development environment will be lost after 24 hours.

**PRODUCTION**   = data-api.n49.ca

**DEVELOPEMENT** = data-api-staging.n49.ca

Please see the individual action articles for specific action endpoints and functionality.
